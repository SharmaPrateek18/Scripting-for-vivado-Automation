# Scripting-for-vivado-Automation

This is a Python script that automates the synthesis and implementation process of Verilog/System Verilog files using Vivado design suite. The script takes in Verilog/System Verilog files from a directory, creates a new Vivado project, adds the files to the project, and runs synthesis and implementation for each top-level module in the files. It also obtains power and timing results from the reports generated after implementation.

The script first imports the required modules - os, shutil, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. It then lists all the Verilog and System Verilog files present in the "Directory/Modules" directory and stores them in the Verilog_files variable. It then extracts the top-level modules from these files and stores them in the top_modules variable.

Next, the script prompts the user to confirm if they want to delete the contents of the "Impl" and "Automation" directories before proceeding. If the user agrees, it deletes the contents of these directories. If not, it terminates the program. It then creates a new Vivado project using a TCL script "tcl_create.tcl" and adds the Verilog and System Verilog files to the project using a TCL script "tcl_add.tcl".

After adding the files, the script creates directories to store the power, timing, and utilization reports for each top-level module. It then runs synthesis and implementation for each module using a TCL script "tcl_run.tcl".

The number of cores the user wants to use for synthesis and implementation of design can be changed by varying the jobs in the "tcl_run.tcl" TCL script. here in the Program script They are considered to be 8.

Next, the script extracts timing and power and utilization information from the reports generated for each module and stores them in Data_Path_Delay, Logic_Delay, Routing_Delay, Total_Power_Consumption, Slice_Logic_Power_Consumption, Signal_Power_Consumption, Static_Power_Consumption, and DC_Power_Consumption, Slice_LUTs_1, LUT_as_Logic_1, LUT_as_Memory_1, Slice_Registers_1, Register_as_Flip_Flop_1, Register_as_Latch_1, F7_Muxes_1, F8_Muxes_1, IBUF_1_1, OBUF_1_1, LUT_6_1, LUT_5_1, LUT_4_1, LUT_3_1, LUT_2_1 variables.

Finally, The script converts the raw data into tabular format and store the results into a .CSV file. The outputs according to the script are stored in Output_of_Automation directory with file name Output_of_Automation.csv

Overall, this script provides a convenient way to automate the process of synthesizing and implementing Verilog/System Verilog files and extracting important information from the reports generated by Vivado design suite.
